## 🎯 Who is this for?

- **Beginners and juniors** — every single rule has a comment explaining what it does and why it exists
- **WordPress developers** — covers all common WP security and performance needs
- **Anyone using Apache** — works on any Apache-based hosting (shared, VPS, dedicated)

---

## 🚀 How to use

1. Download the `.htaccess` file
2. Make a **backup** of your current `.htaccess` first!
3. Replace your existing `.htaccess` at the root of your WordPress installation
4. Read the comments — most sections are **commented out by default**. Activate only what you need by removing the `#` characters.
5. Test your site after each change
